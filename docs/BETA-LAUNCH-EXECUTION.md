### Reddit r/SideProject Post (Jan 24)

**Title:**
After 6 months of nights & weekends, I built an AI workout app that generates plans from plain English. Beta launching Feb 1.

**Body:**
```
Hey r/SideProject!

I've been a lurker here for a while and finally have something to share.

**The Problem I Was Trying to Solve:**
I've lifted weights for 3 years and always struggled with planning workouts. Google "chest workout at home" and you get 50 articles with the same 5 exercises. Hire a trainer? $200+/month. Use an app? They give you generic templates that don't match my equipment or goals.

I wanted something where I could just type "Upper body, 45 minutes, dumbbells only" and get a complete workout instantly. So I built Kinex Fit.

**What It Does:**
- Natural language AI workout generation (powered by Claude)
- Smart workout tracking (you can paste workouts from Instagram or type them conversationally)
- Progress analytics
- Works on web (Next.js)

**Tech Stack:**
- Next.js 15 / React 19
- AWS Bedrock (Claude Opus/Sonnet for AI)
- DynamoDB / Prisma
- TypeScript strict mode
- Stripe for subscriptions

**Current Status:**
Just finished final testing. Launching beta Feb 1 with 30-40 spots. Already have 5 signups from Instagram but looking for people who'll give honest technical feedback.

**What I'm Looking For:**
People who lift 2-4x/week and are willing to give honest feedback. If you track workouts in Notes app or a spreadsheet and want something better, you're exactly who I built this for.

If you're interested: [Link to Google Form]

Or I'll personally generate a free AI workout for the first 50 people who DM me their goals (equipment, time, experience level). No signup required - just testing if the AI actually helps people.

**Why I'm Excited:**
The AI actually works really well. It understands context like "I did chest yesterday so let's focus on back and shoulders today" and generates coherent, balanced workouts. Also added Instagram import because I kept seeing workouts I wanted to save.

Happy to answer questions about the tech stack, AWS costs, or the fitness side!

### Reddit r/Fitness Post (Jan 26)

**Title:**
For people who track workouts in Notes app... I might have built something for you

**Body:**
```
I've been tracking workouts in Apple Notes for 2 years. It works, but it's clunky - no progress graphs, no history search, just a wall of text.

I tried MyFitnessPal, Strong, JEFIT - all felt bloated or required too many taps to log a simple set.

So I built Kinex Fit - basically Notes app but with:
- Progress tracking (PR detection, volume over time)
- Smart parsing (type workouts naturally, app figures it out)
- AI generation (new feature - type goals in plain English, get a workout)
- Instagram import (saw this mentioned a lot - save workouts from IG posts)

Launching beta Feb 1. Built for people like me who want simple tracking without the cruft.

Already have 5 beta signups but looking for ~30 more people who'll give honest feedback.

If you're currently using Notes/spreadsheets and want to try something purpose-built: [Google Form link]

Not trying to reinvent fitness apps, just make tracking less annoying.

- Extend deadline to Feb 5
- Post in r/startups and r/getdisciplined
- Reach out to fitness Discord servers
- Consider small Reddit ad budget ($20-50)

🚨 **If applications are low quality (vague answers, freebie hunters):**
- Add required minimum word count to open-ended questions
- Add "What would you contribute to the beta?" question
- Be more selective, accept only 20-25 highly engaged testers
