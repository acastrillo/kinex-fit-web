2. What's working well for you so far?

**Subject:** 3 quick questions about Kinex Fit

**Body:**

Hey [First Name],

You're one of only 5 people testing Kinex Fit right now, and I want to make sure we're building something you'll actually love.

Could you take 2 minutes to answer these 3 questions?

1. **What problem were you hoping Kinex Fit would solve?**
2. **What feature have you used the most? Why?**
3. **If you could change one thing, what would it be?**

Just hit reply with your thoughts - no need to overthink it.

Thanks for being an early believer!

Best,
[Your Name]

## Day 1 (Follow-up 2 hours later): Referral Incentive

**Subject:** Help us find 10 more testers like you

**Body:**

Hey [First Name],

Quick favor to ask.

We're launching our beta on Feb 1 and looking for 15-20 more people who'll actually use Kinex Fit (not just sign up and ghost us).

If you know anyone who:
- Tracks workouts regularly (or wants to start)
- Gets frustrated with existing fitness apps
- Would give honest feedback

...I'd love to get them early access.

**Here's the deal:**
- Refer 3 friends who complete beta signup = **lifetime free Pro tier** ($168/year value)
- They get the same deal you did (free Elite access during beta)

Your personal referral code: **[FIRSTNAME]BETA**

Just share this link with them:
**https://kinexfit.com/beta-signup**

And tell them to enter your code: **[FIRSTNAME]BETA**

Sound good?

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. This isn't a public offer - only sending this to our first 5 testers because you're the ones who "get it."

## Day 2-3: Testimonial Request (After Feedback Call/Email)

**Subject:** Can I quote you on this?

**Body:**

Hey [First Name],

Really appreciate you taking the time to chat about Kinex Fit [or: reply with your feedback].

One thing you said really stuck with me:

> [Insert their actual quote about problem/solution]

Would you be comfortable with me sharing this on Instagram/social media as we get ready for beta launch? I think it perfectly captures the problem we're solving.

I can:
- Use your first name only (e.g., "Sarah, fitness enthusiast")
- Keep it anonymous (e.g., "Beta tester")
- Credit your Instagram handle (if you want exposure)

Let me know what you'd prefer - or if you'd rather I don't use it at all, totally fine!

Thanks again for being part of this.

Best,
[Your Name]

## Day 4-5: Re-engagement (For Users Who Signed Up But Haven't Logged In)

**Subject:** Quick check-in - need any help with Kinex Fit?

**Body:**

Hey [First Name],

Noticed you signed up for Kinex Fit beta but haven't logged in yet.

Just wanted to check if:
- You had any trouble getting started?
- There's anything confusing about the app?
- You'd like a quick walkthrough of the features?

No pressure at all - I know life gets busy. But if there's anything blocking you from trying it out, I'd love to help.

Also, if Kinex Fit just isn't the right fit for you right now, no worries. Let me know and I'll remove you from beta updates.

Either way, thanks for your interest!

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. The AI workout generation feature is live now - you can literally type "upper body, 30 minutes, dumbbells only" and it'll build the whole workout. Worth checking out if you have 2 minutes.

## Day 7-10: "Power User" Recognition

**Subject:** You're in the top 3 most active testers

**Body:**

Hey [First Name],

Just pulled the stats and wanted to give you a quick shout-out.

You're one of the **top 3 most active testers** - [X workouts logged / Y AI generations / Z days active].

This is exactly the kind of engagement we were hoping for, and it tells us we're building something people actually want to use.

Few questions:
1. What feature has been most valuable to you?
2. Is there anything you wish Kinex Fit could do that it doesn't right now?
3. Would you be interested in being featured as a "Founding Member" when we launch publicly? (social post, case study, etc.)

As a thank you for being so engaged, I'm upgrading you to **lifetime free Elite tier** (our highest plan, normally $19.99/month).

Thanks for helping us build something great.

Best,
[Your Name]

## Micro-Influencer Outreach Template

**Subject:** Would you test our AI workout app?

**Body:**

Hey [Name],

I'm launching Kinex Fit (AI-powered workout tracking) and looking for 10-15 fitness enthusiasts to test it before we go public on Feb 1.

**What it does:**
- Smart workout tracking (paste workouts from IG, type them naturally, app figures it out)
- AI workout generation (type your goals, get a complete plan instantly)
- Progress analytics (track PRs, volume, consistency)

**What you'd get:**
- Lifetime free Pro access ($168/year value)
- Early input on features before public launch
- Credit as a "Founding Tester" if you want recognition

**No obligation to post about it** - just looking for honest feedback from people who actually train.

Interested?

If so, I'll send you early access today.

[Your Name]
Founder, Kinex Fit

1. Your goal (build muscle, lose weight, maintain, etc.)
2. Equipment available (dumbbells, barbell, bodyweight, etc.)
3. Time available (e.g., 30-45 minutes)
4. Any injuries or limitations
